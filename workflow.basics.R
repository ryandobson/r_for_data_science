#Shortcut for the operator symbol "<-" 
#alt and - (alt key + the minus key)

#Use comments to explain the WHY of your code. Not the how or what. 
#the how or what is implied by the code itself 

#Use comments to explain your overall plan of attack/data analytic strategy 


#Calling functions 

#when you are looking for a function you can type the first bit of it and then 
#hit tab. For instance, we want to use the seq() function. Type se and then hit tab
#NOTE: its not very useful here because seq is such a short function name 


seq(from = 1, to = 10)
#The above code produces the same thing as the below code. 
seq(1, 10) 
#If you know the arguments you don't need to specify them. 

#If you want a reference key card hit: 
#alt + shift + k
